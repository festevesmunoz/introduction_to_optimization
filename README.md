# Introduction to optimization

This repository is part of the work done in the class 'Optimization for Large-Scale Data' at the MS Big Data Analytics program, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

In the **first notebook**, various linear programming problems are addressed, including integer programming. In summary, the following issues are covered:

* How to transform a scenario into linear programming in *pyomo*

* Addition of integer programming

* Relaxed problem and sensitivity

* Time consuming study

The **second notebook**, by generating random data from *Beta distribution*, we propose an error metric to optimize as it were a ML optimization. In summary, issued addressed are:

* Optimization using Powel, Conjugate Gradient, BFGS and Newton Conjugate Gradient predifined *Scipy optimize* module.

* Algorithms implementation:

    - Gradient
    - Newton
    - Quasi-Newton

* Algorithms for big data:

    - Coordinate gradient descent
    - Mini-batch gradient descent
    - Subsampled Hessian free inexact method
 
* Optimization of a constrained problem
